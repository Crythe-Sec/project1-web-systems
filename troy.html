                </table>
                A lot of this is made up of mostly hip-hop / rap records <em>(I have a soft spot for old-school underground)</em>, but I also have a healthy
                distribution of rock, metal, and electronic music.<br>
                I use a Fluance R-82 turntable to play my records 
                (Click <em><a href="https://www.fluance.com/rt82w-reference-high-fidelity-vinyl-turntable-natural-walnut" target="_blank">here</a></em> if you're interested), and I make sure to <strong>CLEAN</strong> the
                heck out of them before and after playing them, I want to hold onto them for a <em>while</em>.

            <strong>What does this mean?</strong>
            <p>
                This means I'm qualified to operate <strong>SCUBA</strong> <em>(Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apperatus)</em>
                equipment in open water environment conditions similar to that in which I was trained,
                and to conduct dives to a depth not to exceed a depth of 60fsw <em>(60 feet of saltwater)</em> 
            </p>

            <p>Are you interested in learning to dive? I got my training through <em>NAUI</em>, and if you're interested
            in getting certified through the same agency as I, check out what they offer
             <strong><a href="https://www.naui.org/learn/" target="_blank">here</a>!</strong>
