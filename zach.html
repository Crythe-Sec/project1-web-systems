    <h2>My Hobbies:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Soccer</h3>
            <p>One of my main passions since I was young was playing soccer. Not only does it provide good cardio, but the competitive nature of the game allows me to forget about all the stress in my life. I also get to meet new people with similar interests</p>

        <li>
            <h3>Working out</h3>
            <p>Similar to soccer, going to the gym is a great escape from life. I started for others, but now I do it for myself. Going to the gym is as second nature as eating breakfast for me and I wouldn't want it any other way!</p>

            <h3>Hangout With Friends</h3>
            <p>Hangout with friends has been my favorite part of college so far. I was lucky enough to create a friend group with everyone on my floor in campus housing, and 2 years later we are still very close!</p>

            <h3>Rocket League</h3>
            <p>I've been playing rocket league pretty consistently since 2016. Though not neccesarily proud of this, I have sank over 3,500hrs into this game because through injury or sickness, it is the one thing I can always fall back on when i'm bored!</p>

    <p>My current rank in these columns all resides in Grand Champion.<br>
    This means that within Solos, I am within the top 1.34% percentile of the whole player base.<br>
    In Duos, I am in the top 3.43%, and in Trios, I am in the top 2.97%.<br>
    The main takeaway one may draw from this is that I enjoy my hobbies.</p>
