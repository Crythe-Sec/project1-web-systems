    <p>    "I must not fear.
        Fear is the mind-killer.
        Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
        I will face my fear.
        I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
        And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
        Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain." - The Litany Against Fear - Frank Herbert - </p>
        <p>I gotta say, I was a pretty big fan of the first half of the new Dune movies, I thought it was a pretty good way
            to adapt the book while still being true to the source material. Granted, there's a lot that's lost without
            the borderline unhinged paranoia every character has in their inner dialogue, and I feel like that's a big part of the 
            appeal of the original series, especially considering how that bit ramps up to 11 in the later books, but I digress.
            Overall, really good movie, and I'm pretty hyped for part 2, I hope they pull it off!
