    <p>    I must not fear.
        Fear is the mind-killer.
        Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
        I will face my fear.
        I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
        And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
        Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.</p>
